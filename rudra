To My Beloved, With every beat of my heart, I find myself falling deeper in love with you. You are the one who makes my world brighter, my dreams sweeter, and my days more meaningful. Your love is a beautiful melody that plays in my heart, and I want you to know that I'm here, loving you today and always.
